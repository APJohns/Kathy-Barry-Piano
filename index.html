<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<img src="assets/kathy.jpg" width="40%" style="float:right; margin-left:1%;">
	<p>
	Kathy is an experienced piano teacher with over thirty years of teaching all levels of students from 5 years old to over ninety! 
	</p>
	<p>
	Because students have different learning styles, a variety of methodologies are used. New students are given a free 1/2 hour
	assessment lesson to see if they are ready to learn as well as how they learn.

<!-- Lesson bullet points -->
<div class="panelItem">

<h2>What Lessons Include</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Scales and exercises to build technique.</li>
		<li>Learning to read music, first with easy books, and eventually advanced music.</li>
		<li>Theory homework- this helps students speed up the process of reading and counting.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Is your student ready to learn to play?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The student should want to learn to play the piano and be willing to practice daily.</li>
		<li>A fundamental understanding of basic counting is essential. If they are too young, they become frustrated.</li>
		<li>Basic reading skills. Parents can read instructions I write in a lesson book as long as the student is willing
			to follow them. More important is the student's ability to recognize notes on the staff.</li>
		<li>The student's hand size has to be large enough to reach adjacent keys and be able to tuck the thumb under,
			especially in scales. Most of the time, these skills and hand size come together around the age of 7. I have taught
			gifted students who were younger, but hand size and attention span are essential.</li>
